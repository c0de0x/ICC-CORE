ICC Coin (ICC) is a digital currency which is planned to be used as a sole means of payment in various decentralized applications (DApps) based on the ICC blockchain.  When establishing the system, the project team [made sure](https://internetcafecoin.com/#business) to adhere to the ideals of decentralization. In practice, this means no more financial scandals based on the conflict of interests. The ICC Coin network is operated by masternode owners. All masternode owners have made an initial investment of 1000 ICC and thus they are interested in the increase of the system well-being. Various votes will be held to ensure the safe future of the project.

ICC Coin also has [its own implementation](https://internetcafecoin.com/theme/companyBts/document/ICC_White_Paper_190314.pdf) of the popular Smart Contracts technology based on Javascript. ICC smart contracts have been designed with bets in mind, meaning they will adequately respond to the needs of two planned DApps: [ICC.Exchange](https://internetcafecoin.com/#), a transparent binary options marketplace, and ICC.Bet, a sports betting platform. To test the said smart contracts and their new variants, the ICC team is making a sandbox environment and development kit called Iccjs, see its [GitHub page](https://github.com/InternetCafeCoin/ICC-CORE) to learn more about its code.
